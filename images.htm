<p>On this page you will see that on right there are obviously examples. This page is pretty self-explanatory if you don't know what this page is about read the next paragraph.</p>
<br>
<p>Okay so this page is about image use. There are good ways to use it and bad ways. It really depends on your webpage. There are different many ways to poisons your picture on the page. But again it depends on your webpage.
</p>
<br>
<p> Now you may think that bad image use example looks good but I don't. It really comes down to the webpage and another thing to think about is the size of the image. If you can change the size to something smaller and it still looks good then you should make it smaller. I hope you understand what I’m trying to tell you on this webpage.</p>
